# Project Baseline Assumptions

- File names must be meaningful, consistent, and accurately reflect their responsibilities.
- User interface options (e.g., dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons) must be data-driven and maintainable; hard-coded values should be avoided as they limit extensibility.
- All user-facing text must be internationalized (i18n) and must not be hard-coded.
- Styles must be properly scoped to prevent unintended side effects or cross-component interference.
