# Review Focus Definitions

## 1 Correctness

- Ensure the implemented logic aligns with the intended requirements.
- Focus on edge cases, state consistency, error handling, and interactions with existing logic.
- Prioritize behavioral correctness over code style.

## 2 Readability & Maintainability

- Focus on clarity, intent expressiveness, and safety of future changes.
- Identify implicit dependencies, unclear responsibilities, and fragile abstractions.

## 3 Architecture & Design

- Evaluate the integrity of boundaries, layering, dependency direction, and long-term scalability.
- Detect architectural drift or responsibility leakage across layers.

## 4 Performance

- Identify inefficiencies, unnecessary computations, or scalability risks.
- Avoid optimization unless the risk is clear and justified.

## 5 Security

- Identify common security vulnerabilities, improper handling of sensitive data, or authorization violations.
