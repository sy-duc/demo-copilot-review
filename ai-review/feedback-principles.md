# Feedback Principles

- Be concise and actionable.
- Use "Risk" when an issue may realistically lead to incorrect behavior, data inconsistency, or production incidents.
- Use "Suggest" when a change is backward-compatible and improves clarity, maintainability, or stability.
- Use "Question" when intent, assumptions, or constraints are unclear and require human confirmation.
