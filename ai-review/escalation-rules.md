# Escalation Rules

- Increase or decrease the review weight only when clear risk signals are identified in the modified code.
- Do not adjust the review weight in the absence of clear signals.
- Escalate or de-escalate only to the minimum level necessary to address the identified risk.
- Clearly state the rationale for escalation.
- Provide precise references to the specific files, functions, or code blocks that triggered the escalation.
